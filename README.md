# dataCleanUp - CLI Program for Extracting Useful Data from Text Files

Welcome to the `dataCleanUp` repository! This is a command-line interface (CLI) program written in C++ designed to clean up messy text files and extract useful data from them. It provides a convenient way to process unstructured text data and save the extracted information into a user-defined file.

## Purpose

Many text files contain a mixture of useful and irrelevant information, making it difficult to extract the necessary data manually. `dataCleanUp` simplifies this task by allowing users to specify certain patterns or keywords to identify and extract relevant data from the text file.
